actions.

Rationality maximizes expected performance

Perfection maximizes actual performance.

#### Rationality requires:
1. Information gathering/exploration ÔÅ¨ To maximize future rewards
2. Learn from percepts
3. Extending prior knowledge
4. Being autonomous
5. Compensate for partial prior knowledge, adapt
